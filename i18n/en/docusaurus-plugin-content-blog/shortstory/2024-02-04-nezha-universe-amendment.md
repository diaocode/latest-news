Li Xiang adjusted his black-rimmed glasses, the light from the computer screen reflecting on his slightly tired face. "'Tie Tie' (贴贴)?!" he raised his voice, the sound echoing in the empty conference room, sounding particularly jarring.

Across from him, Manager Wang from the planning department smiled like a Maitreya Buddha, his face shiny with oil. "Editor Li, this is what's popular now. Look, 'Nezha 2 Nezha 1 Tie Tie,' trending number one! It's the traffic password!" He pointed to a picture on the PPT of two chibi Nezhas hugging each other, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

Li Xiang felt a wave of dizziness. He was a senior animation screenwriter who had participated in the creation of the first "Nezha Universe" film. He had originally been full of expectations for the sequel, wanting to delve deeper into the characters' inner worlds and tell a story about growth and redemption. But now, the company actually wanted him to write "Nezha and Nezha Tie Tie"?

"Manager Wang, isn't this inappropriate? Nezha is a hero, not... not..." Li Xiang tried to explain, but couldn't find the right words.

"Not what?" Manager Wang interrupted him, his tone with a hint of displeasure. "Editor Li, haven't you figured out the situation yet? This is the era of traffic! We film what the audience likes. Heroes? Redemption? Who wants to watch that? We want topics, we want heat, we want CP that makes the audience scream!"

The conference room was silent, only Manager Wang's voice echoing. Li Xiang felt a sense of powerlessness rise in his heart. He knew he couldn't change anything.

In the days that followed, Li Xiang was forced to begin the creation of "Tie Tie." Every day he had to rack his brains, thinking about how to make the two Nezhas hug each other, how to create scenes that would make the audience "auntie laugh" (姨母笑). He began to doubt his life, to doubt his former dreams.

One day, Li Xiang met his old colleague Sister Zhang in the tea room. Sister Zhang was the original animator of the first "Nezha Universe" film, and also an idealist full of passion for animation.

"Li Xiang, what have you been busy with lately?" Sister Zhang asked with concern.

Li Xiang smiled wryly and told Sister Zhang about the "Tie Tie" matter.

After listening, Sister Zhang was silent for a long time before slowly saying, "Li Xiang, I know this is painful. But you have to remember what the purpose of our creation is. Is it to bring happiness to the audience, or to satisfy the desires of capital?"

Sister Zhang's words were like a bolt of lightning, hitting Li Xiang's heart. He began to re-examine his work, to examine his values.

A few days later, Li Xiang came to the conference room again. This time, he no longer opposed the "Tie Tie" creative direction, but instead proposed a completely new plan.

"Manager Wang, I think we can do it this way. In the plot, we can arrange for Nezha to accidentally eat the Supreme Lord Lao's elixir, causing his body to mutate and split into two. One Nezha retains the original personality, hating evil and upholding justice; the other becomes soft, cute, and likes to act spoiled. Then, we can have them generate a series of hilarious stories while searching for a way to return to their original state. Of course, the 'Tie Tie' scenes can't be missing, but they have to be logical and have depth." Li Xiang spoke eloquently, his eyes flashing with a long-lost light.

After listening, Manager Wang's eyes lit up. "This is good! This is good! It can satisfy the audience's expectations for 'Tie Tie' while retaining some of the original plot. Editor Li, you are a genius!"

As expected, after the release of "Nezha Universe 2," the box office soared all the way. The "Tie Tie" scenes even sparked heated discussions across the internet, and countless fans went crazy for them.

Li Xiang looked at the screen showing the two Nezhas hugging each other, his heart filled with mixed feelings. He knew that he had compromised, that he had betrayed his former ideals. But he comforted himself, at least he was still trying to maintain a bottom line, still trying to find a balance between commerce and art.

However, at the celebration banquet, Manager Wang suddenly announced a piece of news: "Everyone, I have good news for you! In order to further explore the commercial value of 'Nezha Universe,' our company has decided to launch a 'Nezha Tie Tie' merchandise – two Nezha dolls that can be attached to each other! Moreover, we also plan to launch a series of 'Nezha Tie Tie' emoticons and short videos to let the 'Tie Tie' culture take root in people's hearts!"

After listening, Li Xiang felt nauseous. He put down his glass and silently left the banquet hall.

Walking home, Li Xiang looked up at the starry sky. He suddenly realized that the originally brilliant starry sky had become blurry, as if shrouded in a thick layer of smog.

The next day, Li Xiang submitted his resignation to the company.

On the day he left the company, Li Xiang received a text message from Sister Zhang: "Li Xiang, no matter what choice you make, I support you. Remember, don't forget your original dream."

Li Xiang looked at the text message, his eyes filled with tears. He took a deep breath, turned off his phone, and walked out of the company gate without looking back. He decided to leave this "Tie Tie" world and find his own starry sky.

A year later, an independent animation studio released an animated short film called "Little Hero." The short film tells the story of an ordinary teenager who bravely guards his dream when faced with difficulties. The short film has no fancy special effects, no eye-catching "Tie Tie," but it moved countless viewers with its sincere emotions and profound connotations.

The director of "Little Hero" was Li Xiang.

And the "Nezha Universe," after the "Tie Tie" craze, gradually declined. Audiences began to tire of mindless CP and began to yearn for truly meaningful stories.

This is probably, what goes around comes around. After all, who can live on "Tie Tie" forever?
